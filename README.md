# NTI_FinalProject | Group Project
# This project focuses on bookstore sales analysis, where we collected data from a 
# website through web scraping. We then cleaned and transformed the data using 
# Excel before uploading it to SQL Server to create joined tables. Finally, we 
# utilized Power BI and Tableau for data visualization.
